## Hey there 👋

I’m **Yasin Armooey**, a software engineer based in Iran and mostly working as a **Front-End Developer**.

I enjoy building clean and modern web apps using **React**, **JavaScript**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**. For animations and UI polish, I sometimes use **Framer Motion** to make things feel alive.

I care a lot about **clean code**, **maintainability**, and **solid project structure**. I like writing code that’s not just working, but also readable, scalable, and easy to improve later.
