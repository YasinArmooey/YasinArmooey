## Hi 👋

I'm **Yasin Armooey**, a software engineer based in Iran.  
I primarily work as a **Front-End Web Developer**.

I have experience building web applications using modern tools and technologies such as **React**, **JavaScript**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**, and I occasionally use **Framer Motion** for animations.

I always try to deliver high-quality work by following best practices, including **clean code**, **maintainability**, and **proper project structure**, with a strong focus on scalable architecture.
