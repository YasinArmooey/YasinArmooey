## Hey there 👋

I’m **Yasin Armooey**, a software engineer based in Iran and mostly working as a **Front-End Developer**.

I enjoy building clean and modern web apps using **React**, **JavaScript**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**. I sometimes use **Framer Motion** to add smooth animations and better UI vibes.

I care about **clean code**, **maintainability**, and **solid project structure**. I like writing code that’s not just working, but also readable and scalable.
